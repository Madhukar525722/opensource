This change will allow user to pass in which group they want to launch the engine. \r\n\r\nThe flow of implementation is :\r\n- Take input of preferred groups\r\n    - If it is not defined, take the default route, pick the first group from the users groups list\r\n    - If its defined\r\n        - It will iterate the list, and look for the first match\r\n        - If no match found, it will return the first group from the users groups list\r\n\r\n1. In this way, for every group there will be single engine, which can be re-used.\r\n2. First user launching the engine is implemented to handle the scenarios where Hadoop groups are not the yarn users.\r\n3. For security concerns in 2nd point, we can have fine grained access control on session level, using Apache Ranger. \r\n\r\n## Types of changes :bookmark:\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen there is any predicate missing in getPartitionsbyFilter and it tries to fetch all the partitions, the request is broken into smaller chunks as:\r\n1. Retrieve the names of all partitions using getPartitionNames\r\n2. Divide the partition names list into smaller batches.\r\n3. Fetch the partitions using their names with function getPartitionsByNames.\r\n4. If the fetching fails, it reduces the batch size by 2 and looks for lesser number of partitions till the maxRetries hit\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe change is to address the issue of heavy load on HMS, when there are huge number of partitions(~600,000), the metadata size exceeds the 2Gb limit on the thrift server buffer size. Hence we get socket time out and HMS crashes with OOM as well. Tried to replicate same behaviour as [HIVE-27505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-27505) \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\nTo enable batching they should be using parameters as:\r\nspark.sql.hive.metastore.batchSize = 1000 , by default it is disabled\r\nspark.sql.metastore.partition.batch.retry.count = 3\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTested in local environment with following performance \r\nWith batch size = 1\r\n24/09/28 18:11:21 INFO Shim_v2_3: Fetching all partitions completed in 717 ms\r\n \r\nWith batch size = -1\r\n24/09/28 18:14:16 INFO Shim_v2_3: Fetching all partitions completed in 51 ms.\r\n \r\nWith batch size = 10\r\n24/09/28 18:16:20 INFO Shim_v2_3: Fetching all partitions completed in 115 ms.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n",

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen there is any predicate missing in getPartitionsbyFilter and it tries to fetch all the partitions, the request is broken into smaller chunks as:\r\n1. Retrieve the names of all partitions using getPartitionNames\r\n2. Divide the partition names list into smaller batches.\r\n3. Fetch the partitions using their names with function getPartitionsByNames.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe change is to address the issue of heavy load on HMS, when there are huge number of partitions(~600,000), the metadata size exceeds the 2Gb limit on the thrift server buffer size. Hence we get socket time out and HMS crashes with OOM as well. Tried to replicate same behaviour as [HIVE-27505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-27505) \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\nTo enable batching they should be using parameters as:\r\nspark.sql.hive.metastore.batchSize = 1000 , by default it is disabled\r\nspark.sql.metastore.partition.batch.retry.count = 3\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTested in local environment with following performance \r\nWith batch size = 1\r\n24/09/28 18:11:21 INFO Shim_v2_3: Fetching all partitions completed in 718 ms\r\n \r\nWith batch size = -1\r\n24/09/28 18:14:16 INFO Shim_v2_3: Fetching all partitions completed in 51 ms.\r\n \r\nWith batch size = 10\r\n24/09/28 18:16:20 INFO Shim_v2_3: Fetching all partitions completed in 127 ms.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n",

First is to overwrite the KeeperException class, raised in this PR (KeeperException for zookeeper34 is pulled from \r\n[zookeeper-3.4.14](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/release-3.4.14/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/KeeperException.java) for zookeeper36 is pulled from [zookeeper-3.6](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/branch-3.6/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/KeeperException.java) )\r\n2. Step 2 will be for backporting the ZOOKEEPER-4377 change\r\n\r\n### _How was this patch tested?\r\nThis was built locally and tested in local using following steps:\r\n1. perform `build/mvn clean package` to generate `kyuubi-relocated-zookeeper-parent/kyuubi-relocated-zookeeper-34/target/kyuubi-relocated-zookeeper-34-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`\r\n2. download and install [apache-kyuubi-1.9.1-bin.tgz](https://dlcdn.apache.org/kyuubi/kyuubi-1.9.1/apache-kyuubi-1.9.1-bin.tgz)\r\n3. replace `KYUUBI_HOME/jars/kyuubi-relocated-zookeeper-34-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` with `kyuubi-relocated-zookeeper-34-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`\r\n4. perform `bin/kyuubi-zk-cli -server xxxxx:2181` to connect a Zookeeper cluster\r\n",
